# publish.sh — prepare a lockstep release locally. It does not publish.
#
# The name is kept for muscle memory; `pnpm release:prepare` is the honest one.
# What this does:
#
#   1. refuse to run from a dirty working tree
#   2. refuse to bump unless every package already agrees on one version
#   3. bump every package (changesets if any exist, otherwise a literal sed)
#   4. verify the bump landed on every package
#   5. tell you what to do next
#
# What it deliberately no longer does: publish, tag, or talk to a registry.
#
# It used to do all three, in the worst possible order. It bumped versions in
# the working tree, published from that uncommitted state, and then tagged —
# which tagged the commit the bump sat on top of, not the bump itself. The tag
# named a tree that did not contain the versions that had just been published.
#
# Publishing now happens in one place only: the Publish workflow, dispatched
# manually, which installs, builds, tests, runs the preflight, publishes, and
# only then tags. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
