/**
 * Release preflight — refuse to bump or publish from an incoherent state.
 *
 *   node scripts/release-preflight.mjs --pre-bump
 *   node scripts/release-preflight.mjs --expect <version>
 *
 * This repository releases every public package in lockstep. That is not a
 * convention someone wrote down — it is what `scripts/publish.sh` enforces with
 * a literal `sed` keyed on `packages/core`'s version, and it is what every
 * published release has done: the packages share one version set, and all of them
 * skipped 0.1.4 together.
 *
 * Nothing checked that, so one package drifting out of step would be silent,
 * and the drift would compound:
 *
 *   - the `sed` stops matching the drifted package, so the next bump skips it;
 *   - the publish loop derives one version from `packages/core` and skips any
 *     package already at it — which is exactly the package that changed;
 *   - `pnpm pack` rewrites the umbrella's `workspace:*` deps to EXACT versions,
 *     so an unbumped umbrella pins the old copy of whatever did change;
 *   - the release tag comes from `packages/core` too, so it can name a version
 *     that was never published.
 *
 * There is no override flag. A failure here means the release is not safe, and
 * an escape hatch would be reached for at exactly the wrong moment.
