# @naculus/connect

Cross-chain Web3 connection SDK. Pure library, no frontend components.

## Positioning

`connect-lib/` is a framework-agnostic library monorepo that only handles **connection logic**. Frontend components (React hooks, UI components) live in the separate [`connect-appkit/`](https://github.com/naculus-official/connect-suite/tree/dev/packages/appkit) project.

```

└── connect-appkit/     ← Frontend components (React)
```

## Quick start

> **⚠️ 0.x** — the API can still change between minor versions.
> Published on npm; see [Releasing](CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing) for how versions move.

```sh
pnpm add @naculus/connect
# Or individual packages: pnpm add @naculus/connect-core @naculus/connector-walletconnect
```

> **Use React?** Install `connect-appkit` instead — it wraps the library in hooks.
> See [connect-appkit](https://github.com/naculus-official/connect-suite/tree/dev/packages/appkit).

```ts
import { ConnectorManager } from "@naculus/connect-core";
import { WalletConnectConnector, createWalletConnectConnector } from "@naculus/connector-walletconnect";

const manager = new ConnectorManager();

// Register connector
const wcConnector = createWalletConnectConnector({
  projectId: "your_project_id",
  metadata: { name: "My App", description: "...", url: "...", icons: [] },
});
manager.register("walletconnect", wcConnector);

// Connect
const session = await manager.connect("walletconnect");

// Sign
const signature = await manager.signMessage({ message: "hello" });

// Disconnect
await manager.disconnect();
```

## Standards compliance

| Standard | Status | Package |
|------|------|------|
| EIP-1193 (Provider API) | ✅ | connector-evm-injected |
| EIP-6963 (Multi Injected Provider Discovery) | ✅ | connector-evm-injected |
| EIP-4361 / CAIP-122 (SIWx) | ✅ | siwx |
| ERC-1271 (contract-account signatures) | ✅ | siwx |
| ERC-6492 (pre-deployment signatures) | ✅ | siwx |
| EIP-5792 (wallet calls) | ✅ | core, connector-evm-injected, connector-walletconnect, connector-coinbase |
| Solana Wallet Standard | ✅ | connector-solana |
| WalletConnect v2 (CAIP-25) | ✅ | connector-walletconnect |

### EIP-5792 — asking before executing

All four methods are implemented: `wallet_getCapabilities`,
`wallet_sendCalls`, `wallet_getCallsStatus` and `wallet_showCallsStatus`.

The point of the capability query is that an application decides how to execute
*before* it sends anything, rather than learning the answer from a rejection:

```ts
const { atomic, current } = useCapabilities();   // @naculus/connect-appkit-react

if (atomic === "supported") {
  await sendCalls(calls);        // one batch, all or nothing
} else {
  // Sequential. An approve can land and the swap it was for can fail, so an
  // application that needs all-or-nothing should stop here instead.
}
```

`atomic` has three values, not two. A wallet that does not implement
`wallet_getCapabilities` has not said no — it has said nothing, and EIP-5792 is
explicit that absence is not a denial. `"unknown"` also covers a query that
failed and one still in flight.

The wire format is decoded in one place (`core/src/eip5792.ts`) because it
changed between the draft and 2.0.0, and three connectors each decoded it
inline and each got it wrong differently: one invented a "no" for a wallet that
was never asked, one read `Boolean({ supported: false })` as true, one accepted
`status: "supported"` and dropped `"ready"`.

## Documentation

Guides:

- [Upgrading from 0.10 to 0.11](docs/guides/upgrading-to-0.11.md) — the CCTP V2 bridge for native USDC (`@naculus/connect-core/cctp`) and session-key error messages that now end with the reason (match on `code`).
- [Upgrading from 0.7 to 0.10](docs/guides/upgrading-to-0.10.md) — what changed in 0.8.0–0.10.0 and the one action needed (hand-built `eip7702` scopes).
- [Paying x402 from an external wallet](docs/guides/x402-external-wallet.md) — MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rabby, OKX or Phantom with `walletX402Signer` + `createX402Fetch`, then `verifyX402Settlement`.
- [Charging with x402 on your server](docs/guides/x402-server.md) — `requirePayment` + `settlePayment`, settled with viem.
- [Periodic authorization](docs/guides/periodic-authorization.md) — per-period spending limits, enforced by the device or on chain.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build          # Build all packages
pnpm test:run       # Run tests
pnpm tsc --noEmit   # Type check
```

### Run single package only

```sh
pnpm --filter @naculus/connect-core build
pnpm --filter @naculus/connector-solana test
```

### WalletConnect tests (requires public URL)

```sh
pnpm tunnel           # Start tunnel (default port 3000)
pnpm tunnel:3000      # Specify port
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does connect-lib/ have UI components?**
No. Frontend components are in `connect-appkit/`.

**Q: What's the difference between wallet-engine and connector-embedded?**
`wallet-engine` is a pure crypto library (key generation, signing) — it doesn't know what `UniversalConnector` is. `connector-embedded` is the adapter layer that wraps wallet-engine into a connector.

**Q: How to add a new connector?**
Implement the `UniversalConnector` interface (`packages/core/src/connector.ts`), then register it in `ConnectorManager`.
