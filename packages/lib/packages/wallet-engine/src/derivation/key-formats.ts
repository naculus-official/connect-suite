/**
 * The text forms other wallets read and write.
 *
 * No EIP or SLIP specifies how a private key is written down. The derivation
 * standards — BIP-39, BIP-32/44, SLIP-0010, SLIP-0044 — decide which key
 * belongs to which account, and those are what guarantee a recovery phrase
 * opens the same accounts everywhere. The text encoding of a raw key is
 * convention, and it converged: hex with an `0x` prefix on Ethereum, base58 of
 * the 64-byte keypair on Solana.
 *
 * Convention is enough to interoperate, but only if it is followed exactly.
 * Handing a user 64 raw bytes and expecting them to find a base58 encoder is
 * an export that does not work — which is the same as no export, for the
 * person trying to move their funds somewhere else.
 *
 * These functions exist so both directions are covered and testable:
 * everything this wallet emits can be pasted into MetaMask or Phantom, and
 * everything those emit can be pasted back.
