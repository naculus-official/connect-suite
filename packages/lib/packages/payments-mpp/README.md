# @naculus/payments-mpp

Pay [MPP](https://mpp.dev) (Machine Payments Protocol) `evm` charges with a
policy-bound Naculus session key.

```ts
import { SessionKeyManager } from "@naculus/connect-core";
import { createMppFetch, sessionKeyMppSigner } from "@naculus/payments-mpp";

const signer = await sessionKeyMppSigner(manager, sessionId);
const pay = createMppFetch({ signer, chainIds: [8453] });

const { response, paid, receipt } = await pay("https://api.example.com/data");
```

What it does on a `402` with `WWW-Authenticate: Payment` challenges:

1. Parses every challenge (RFC 9110 auth-params; several may share one
   header) and refuses one that arrived through a redirect. The paid retry
   never follows a redirect.
2. Picks the first challenge it can pay: `method="evm"`, `intent="charge"`,
   `credentialTypes` including `"authorization"`, no `splits`, not expired,
   on an allowed chain (`chainIds`), for a token whose EIP-712 domain it
   knows. Every other method, intent and credential type (`permit2`,
   `transaction`, `hash`) is refused.
3. Builds the EIP-3009 `TransferWithAuthorization` the spec prescribes —
   `nonce = keccak256(id ‖ realm)`, `validAfter = 0`, `validBefore` = the
   challenge's `expires` (or now + 300 s) — and has the session key sign it.
   **Policy is enforced by the session key, not here**: give it
   `allowedRecipients` (payees), `tokenAllowances` (budget per token) and
   `allowedChainIds`. **Without `allowedRecipients` the key pays whatever
   `recipient` the server names**, up to the token budget.
4. Retries once with `Authorization: Payment …` (or `Payment-Authorization`
   when the challenge selects it). A second `402` is an error, not a second
   payment. A malformed `Payment-Receipt`, or one naming another challenge,
   leaves the paid response intact with `receipt: null`.

## Token domains

MPP challenges do not carry the token's EIP-712 name and version.
`USDC_DOMAINS` covers Circle USDC on Ethereum, Sepolia, Base, Base Sepolia,
Arbitrum One, Optimism and Polygon (each read from the token and checked
against its `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()`). For another token, pass `tokenDomains`;
an entry there takes precedence over the built-in table.

Spec: tempoxyz/mpp-specs `draft-httpauth-payment-01`, `draft-evm-charge-00`.

## Solana charges

```ts
import { solanaPaymentRpc } from "@naculus/connect-core";

const pay = createMppFetch({
  signer, // optional: evm charges, paid by the session key
  solana: {
    signer: solanaRoles.signer,
    rpc: solanaPaymentRpc(rpcUrl),
    networks: ["mainnet"],
  },
});
```

`method="solana"` charges (pull mode, SPL tokens) are paid by the **connected
wallet**: one `TransferChecked` to the recipient's associated token account,
`externalId` as the memo. With `feePayer: true` the server's `feePayerKey`
pays the fee and co-signs; otherwise the payer pays it and signs alone. The
RPC must serve the challenge's cluster, and the mint must match the
challenge's `decimals` and `tokenProgram`. Native SOL, splits, push mode,
confidential transfers and `localnet` are refused. The blockhash always
comes from your RPC (the server's advisory `recentBlockhash` is ignored), and
the wallet's result is checked as for x402 — except that wallets adding
Lighthouse assertions (Phantom, Solflare) are refused, because MPP servers
reject such transactions.

A Solana session key (`solana: { sessionKey: { manager, id }, rpc }`, see the
payments-x402 README) pays `solana` charges without a prompt, within its
scope — and only charges whose fee the server sponsors (`feePayer: true`).

## Solana metered sessions

`createMppSessionFetch` opens one escrow channel for a
`method="solana", intent="session"` challenge, then sends cumulative vouchers
without another wallet prompt. The app owns the meter: report consumption with
`pay.meter.add(units)` before a request, or pass `{ units }` on that request.
The server cannot choose how many units the delegated key signs.
Units are committed as soon as the delegated key signs their voucher, even if
the HTTP request later fails. Do not retry a failed request with the same
`units`; report only newly consumed units. Units added to `pay.meter` while a
voucher request is in flight remain pending for the next voucher.

Pass a `ChannelVoucherKeyManager`, the connected owner wallet, and an RPC that
implements `isBlockhashValid`. The policy pins the one payee, the token
(`mint`; every amount is in its base units), per-unit price, deposit,
cumulative/delta limits, expiry, and minimum forced-close grace period (one
hour by default). A challenge naming any other mint is refused before any key
is created or anything is signed. Before the wallet signs, the client checks the
RPC cluster, the reviewed channel-program address/deployment, mint and
Token-2022 extensions, challenge policy, and server blockhash. Operator-signed
vouchers, resume, top-up, and distribution co-recipients are refused.

```ts
const pay = createMppSessionFetch({
  rpc,
  signer: solanaRoles.signer,
  keyManager: voucherKeys,
  policy: {
    recipient: merchant,
    mint: USDC_MINT, // the token every amount below is denominated in
    amount: 10n,
    deposit: 1_000_000n,
    maxCumulative: 1_000_000n,
    maxDelta: 10_000n,
    expiresAt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 7_200,
  },
});

await pay("https://api.example.com/session"); // owner approves channel open
await pay("https://api.example.com/session", { units: 25n });
await pay.close(); // server settles the final voucher and refunds the rest
```

Voucher expiry is finite and sealed into the delegated-key policy. It must
outlast the channel's grace period so the server can settle the last accepted
voucher. The reference `@solana/mpp` client instead defaults to 2100, and
its server applies the same settlement-window check. The client keeps the
active key id in memory and does not call `ChannelVoucherKeyManager.list()` on
request paths (that method intentionally decrypts every stored key).

For recovery, `forceClose()` signs and submits `requestClose` only through the
app-supplied `sendTransaction`, then returns a `withdrawPayer()` function.
That function reads the channel state, refuses with the exact retry timestamp
while the grace period is active, submits the permissionless seal for an
elapsed `Closing` channel through the same wallet and broadcast path, then
withdraws the payer's remainder. An already `Sealed` channel skips the seal
transaction.
`pay.channels` exposes the open channel so a UI can offer cooperative or forced
close.
If the signed open transaction reaches the server but its response fails or
lacks a matching receipt, the thrown `MppError` has a `channelId` property and
the channel remains in `pay.channels` for `forceClose()` recovery. The voucher
key is still revoked; failures before the transaction is sent retain nothing.

## Verifying a receipt

Charge results expose `settlementBinding` with the EIP-3009 nonce or Solana
signed-message hash and all expected transfer facts. Session `close()` results
expose the channel and final voucher cumulative. Verification is opt-in:

```ts
import { verifyMppSettlement } from "@naculus/payments-mpp";

const chargeCheck = await verifyMppSettlement(chargeResult, rpc);
const closeCheck = await verifyMppSettlement(closeResult, rpc);
```

Only `status: "verified"` proves settlement. `pending` may be retried; a
server receipt or reference alone remains untrusted. The caller-supplied RPC
is checked against the expected chain or cluster. Channel verification also
requires the reviewed program to own the account, distributed status, and a
settled watermark equal to the last signed voucher; a reclaimed account is
reported as unavailable, not verified.

## Server: `@naculus/payments-mpp/server`

The other side of the same charges: issue challenges, verify credentials,
settle them and answer with a receipt or an RFC 9457 problem. The server's
keys are never held here — settlement goes through functions you pass in.

```ts
import {
  createChallenge,
  memoryReplayStore,
  paymentRequiredResponse,
  problemResponse,
  receiptHeaders,
  settleCredential,
  verifyCredential,
} from "@naculus/payments-mpp/server";

const offer = {
  method: "evm",
  request: {
    amount: "10000",
    currency: "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
    recipient: payee,
    methodDetails: { chainId: 8453, credentialTypes: ["authorization"] },
  },
};
const replay = memoryReplayStore(); // one process only; share it otherwise
const fresh = () => [
  createChallenge({
    realm: "api.example.com",
    intent: "charge",
    ...offer,
    expires: new Date(Date.now() + 5 * 60_000),
    secret,
  }),
];

async function handle(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const credential = req.headers.get("Authorization");
  if (!credential) return paymentRequiredResponse(fresh());
  try {
    const verified = await verifyCredential(credential, {
      secret,
      realm: "api.example.com",
      accept: [offer], // what this resource charges
      evm: { rpc }, // authorizationState + balanceOf
      replay,
    });
    const { header } = await settleCredential(verified, {
      replay,
      evm: { submit }, // sends transferWithAuthorization, awaits the receipt
    });
    return new Response(body, { headers: receiptHeaders(header) });
  } catch (error) {
    return problemResponse(error, fresh());
  }
}
```

- **Challenge ids** are HMAC-SHA256 over the bound parameters exactly as
  `draft-httpauth-payment-01` specifies (the spec's test vectors are
  reproduced in the tests); any edited parameter fails verification.
  `previousSecrets` keeps rotated secrets valid until their challenges
  expire.
- **`accept`** is required: a genuine challenge for a cheaper resource of the
  same server is refused.
- **EVM** (`type="authorization"`): `to`/`value` match the request, `nonce`
  is `keccak256(id ‖ realm)`, the validity window sits inside the challenge,
  the EIP-712 signature recovers to `from` (EOA signatures only), the token
  is in `USDC_DOMAINS` or `evm.tokenDomains`, and `rpc` reports the nonce
  unused and the balance sufficient.
- **Solana** (`type="transaction"`, pull mode, SPL; the request must name
  `tokenProgram`): the fee payer is the server's `feePayerKey` (slot empty)
  or the payer (fully signed); only ComputeBudget limit/price, one
  `TransferChecked` of exactly `amount`/`decimals` into the recipient's
  associated token account, and at most one memo (equal to `externalId` when
  there is one); a sponsored transaction never names the fee payer in an
  instruction and pays at most `solana.maxPriorityFeeLamports` (default
  10 000) in priority fees; the payer's signature verifies. Settlement calls
  `signAsFeePayer` (sponsored only), checks that only the fee payer's slot
  changed, simulates, sends and waits for confirmation through your `rpc`.
- **Replay**: settlement consumes the challenge id, and the EIP-3009 nonce or
  the Solana payer signature, before anything is sent. A shared store needs
  an atomic `consume`.
